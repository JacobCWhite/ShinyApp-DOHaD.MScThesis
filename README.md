This Shiny app presents the data visualizations from my master’s thesis in Paleopathology, which investigated the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) and embodiment using a Portuguese skeletal collection.

DOHaD explores how environmental factors influence developmental biological programming, leading to long-term health outcomes. Research indicates that intrauterine deprivation and physiological stress during development are risk factors for adult health challenges. Several hypotheses fall under DOHaD, each with unique assumptions and predictions. The mismatch hypothesis, also known as the predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis, suggests that consistent poor conditions result in relatively healthy outcomes, while a shift from poor fetal to good adult environments, or vice versa, leads to poor adult health outcomes. The silver spoon hypothesis posits that poor early life conditions result in poorer health outcomes regardless of the adult environment, whereas those with good early life conditions fare better in adulthood. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposes that developmental constraints prime an individual's metabolism to conserve energy for survival, but predispose them to later-life pathologies such as Type II diabetes.

Immune competence may also be subject to developmental programming. Immune tissues essential for immune competence develop early in life, and stunted development may suppress the immune system. For instance, studies in rural Gambia found that children who developed in utero during the “hungry season” had an increased risk of early mortality from infectious diseases. In bioarchaeology, the lack of preserved soft tissues means correlating skeletal remains with immune function and developmental disruptions. Environmental conditions impact dental and skeletal development by delaying and stunting growth, often caused by infections, social factors, and malnutrition. Bioarchaeologists incorporate the concept of ‘embodiment’ into their analyses, suggesting that individuals physically manifest their social and ecological environments in their bodies. Those from lower socioeconomic statuses may embody structural violence through poor health outcomes and development, allowing skeletal remains to reveal socio-political-economic impacts on marginalized individuals.

The skeleton forms at different rates, so multiple health indicators are used to identify growth disruptions at various ages. Early growth disruptions are considered more significant for long-term health. Vertebral neural canals (VNC) are reliable for assessing early life growth since their development starts in utero and is completed by age 5. The three primary growth sites for vertebrae are the centrum and two neural arches, which fuse by age 5, making VNC diameter relatively “fixed”.

The data for this study came from the Lisbon Identified Skeletal Collection at the National Museum of Natural History and Science in Lisbon, Portugal. The collection includes nearly 1,690 well-preserved individuals, mostly Portuguese natives born between 1806 and 1958, who died between 1880 and 1984. This period was marked by political instability, including the fall of the monarchy, both world wars, and the rise of Europe’s longest authoritarian right-wing regime. The collection’s historical context adds to its significance.

Exhumed in 1975 from abandoned burial plots in Lisbon's municipal cemeteries, the collection includes biographical details such as age at death, sex, birth and death years, birth and death addresses, cause of death, and occupation. The study focused on individuals aged 20 and older, with 48% having died of tuberculosis and 52% from non-tuberculosis-related causes. The sample comprised 151 individuals: 90 males (59.6%) and 60 females (39.7%).

Long bones (femora, tibiae, fibulae, humeri, ulnae, and radii) without post-mortem damage were measured for maximum length using a standard osteometric board. Bones with pathologies affecting length were excluded. Each measurement was taken twice and averaged to minimize intra-observer error. Vertebrae examined included C3, C4, C5, T8, T9, T10, L2, L3, and L4. Anterior-posterior (AP) and transverse (TR) neural canal diameters, along with vertebral body height (VBH), were measured with analog sliding calipers to the nearest 0.1mm. Vertebrae with post-mortem damage, pathologies, or morphological changes were excluded, and measurements were taken twice and averaged to ensure accuracy.

You can do your own data exploration by following the link above. 

The objective of the project was to look for any correlations between variables so you can select which variables you are interested in comparing. For example, you could look to see if shorter femur lengths coincides with an increased likelihood of early mortality. However. males are much more likely to have longer femur lengths than females so make sure to "facet by sex"!.
